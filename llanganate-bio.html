My name is Kimberly Llanganate. I am an economics and information management and technology major. I am interested in the intersection of business and technology and am interested in web development. I hold board positions in a couple different organizations around campus. I am the recruiter for the Black and Latinx Information Science and Technology Society, and the VP of DEI for The Womens Network. Outside of school, I enjoy listening to music, doing yoga, and watching sitcoms, my favorite being: How I Met Your Mother. I am the oldest in the family, and have a little brother, little sister, a dog and a two month old kitten.
